### How to start writing your contract

- Firstly you have to write the name for your file make sure you are writing ``` .sol ```at the end of the name like if you have learned c you are going to write .c extension, JavaScript you are going to write .js extension in the end like this.
- and then you have to write version of your compiler like.. ```pragma solidity 0.8.26;
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT``` this shows that your compiler will only compile on the version 0.8.26 and if you writing ```pragma solidity >=0.8.26 <0.8.25 ;``` will shows you the compiler version less than 0.8.25 and the greater than or is equal to version 0.8.26 , your compiler will compile. and make sure your compiler's version varies as time passes.
- Also write the license identifier in comments for your legal accomodations with clients.

Deploy the code Metamask [this is dummy metamask accounts here, hence you can deploy it to your real metamask account but deployment on fake metamask accounts is the good way to practice.]
###### Remember one thing if you have deployed your contract on real metamask account you can not change your account again, hence there are such methods from which you can change it, but ultimately you can not change it, so practice in a fake metamask accounts is a good way to handle your contract.

After the deployment of your contract you can see "Deployed Contracts" section below your "Deploy Button."
from where you can add some data inside and it will gives you the output.
