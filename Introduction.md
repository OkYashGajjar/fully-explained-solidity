# SOLIDITY

### What is solidity.
 - Solidity is designed specifically for writing self-executing contracts that automatically enforce agreements between parties. These contracts are stored on a blockchain, making them tamper-proof and transparent.
 - This language is object oriented programming language (means you can create an object, structure etc... ), if you learned C, Java, or C++ before you will have the basic idea of OOP.
 - This language is Statically typed which means you have to declare the datatype before the compilation. in general there are basically 2 types of languages 
1) Statically typed : in this you have to declare the datatype before the compilation ``` uint i = 0; ``` same like Java, C, C++... 
2) Dynamically typed : in this you can check the datatype in which the compilation is processing on same like javaScript, python... ] 

- Solidity's syntax is similar to JavaScript, C++, and Python, making it relatively easy for developers familiar with these languages to learn.

###  How Solidity Works

- Writing the code: Developers write smart contracts in Solidity, defining the contract's logic, state variables (data stored in the contract), and functions (actions that can be performed on the contract).   

- Compilation: The Solidity code is then compiled into bytecode, a low-level representation that the EVM can understand.   
- Deployment: The compiled bytecode is deployed to the Ethereum blockchain, where it is assigned a unique address.   
- Execution: When a user interacts with the smart contract by sending a transaction to its address, the EVM executes the corresponding function in the contract.
- State changes: The execution of a smart contract can change its state variables, which are permanently recorded on the blockchain. these changes are irreversible and transparent to all participants on the network.
